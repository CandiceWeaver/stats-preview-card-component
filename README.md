## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- SCSS

### What I learned

I used this project to review my knowledge of Flexbox and CSS Grid.

### Continued development

I found the process of making the component responsive on mobile more difficult than I remember, so going forward I will refer to this project next time I get stuck on responsive design.

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This is my number 1 resource for remembering which CSS styles I need to use when I'm stuck.
